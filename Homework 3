\begin{problem}{3.1.5 (10)} 
Let x and y be any two positive numbers. Using the definitions in Problems 3.1.3.and 3.1.4, show that $gcd(x, y) = \frac{xy}{lcm(x,y)}$

(a) by using the characterizations of gcd and lcm in terms of the prime factorization, and

(b) directly by proving that for any natural z, z is a common factor of x and y if and only if z divides xy and xy/z is a common multiple of x and y.

\begin{problem}{3.3.2 (15)}

Let $n$ be any natural. Define $I_n$ to be the set of all naturals $a$ such that $a < n$
and $a$ and $n$ are relatively prime. The \textbf{Euler totient function}  $\phi(n)$ is the size of $I_n$.

(a) Describe the sets I11 and I12.

(b) Explain why $\phi(n)=n-1$ if and only if is prime.

(c) Explain why if n is a power of 2, other than $2^0 = 1$, then $\phi(n) = n/2$.

(d) Explain why a natural $a < n$ has an inverse modulo n if and only if it is in In.

(e) Show that if a and b are in In, then a·b is congruent modulo n to a member of In.

(f) Give an example where a and b are in In but a + b is not congruent modulo n to any
member of In.

\begin{problem}{3.3.N (10)}
Show that if $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, there are exactly $p + q - 2$ positive naturals that are less than $pq$ and not relatively prime with $pq$.

\begin{problem}{3.5.3 (10)}
Suppose we are given a system of congruences:
\newline
\newline
\centerline{$\begin{aligned}
   x \equiv a_1 (\mod m_1)
\\   x \equiv a_2 (\mod m_2)
\\\ldots
\\   x \equiv a_k (\mod m_k)
\end{aligned}
$}
without any guarantee that the $m_i$’s are pairwise relatively prime.

(a) A prime power is a number that can be written $p^e$ for some prime number p and some positive number e. A consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (which we’ll prove soon) is that any number has a unique factorization into prime powers. Show that we can convert any congruence into an equivalent system of congruences where each base is a prime power and the bases are pairwise relatively prime.

(b) Let p be a prime number, and suppose that we have a system of congruences where each base is a power of p. Explain how to tell whether the system has a solution, and how to find it.

(c) Using parts (a) and (b), explain how to determine whether an arbitrary system of congruences has a solution, and if so how to find all solutions.

\begin{problem}{3.6.5 (10XC)}
(Requires exposure to complex numbers.) The \textbf{Gaussian} integers are the subset of the complex numbers that are of the form $a + bi$ where a and b are integers and i is the square root of $-1$. The notions of division and primality can be made to make sense in this domain as well:

(a) The length of a Gaussian integer a+bi is defined to be $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.
Show that if a + bi and c + di are two Gaussian integers, the length of their product is the product of their lengths.

(b) A unit is a Gaussian integer of length 1. What are the units?

(c) A prime is a Gaussian integer whose length is greater than 1 and which cannot be written as the product of two Gaussian integers unless one is a unit. Prove that any nonzero Gaussian integer has at least one factorization as a product of primes times a unit.

(d) Prove that 1+i is a prime and that 2 is not.

(e) Prove that if the square of the length of a Gaussian integer is a prime number in the
usual sense, then the Gaussian integer is a prime.

\begin{problem}{4.1.5 (10)}
(uses Java) Give a recursive definition of the “less than” operator on numbers. (You may refer to equality of numbers in your definition.) Write a pseudo-Java method \texttt{boolean isLessThan (natural x, natural y)} that returns \texttt{true} if and only if $x < y$ and uses only our given methods. (Hint: Follow the example of the functions \texttt{plus} and \texttt{times} in the text.)

Let the finite sequence a0,a1,...,an be defined by the rule ai = a0 · ri, where r is some
number not equal to 1. Prove by induction that the sum of the terms in the sequence is
$\frac{a_0-a_{n+1}}{1-r}$ (where $a_{n+1}$ is defined by the same rule even though it is not part of the sequence).

\begin{problem}{4.3.5 (10)}
Let $\Sigma = \{a,b,c\}$ and let $L_n$ for each natural n be the language consisting of exactly those strings with two a’s, two b’s, and n c’s. Discover a formula for the size of $L_n$ in terms of n, and prove your formula correct by induction. (Hint: You may find it useful to first solve this problem for various similar languages: strings with n c’s and respectively no a’s or b’s, one a and no b’s, one of each, and two a’s and one b.)
